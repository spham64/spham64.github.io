          I am a student at UNCC from Charlotte, NC, with a passion for solving
          challenging problems using cutting-edge technologies and tools. This
          passion has led me into the software development field, where I have
          researched and worked on ways to support literacy and education for
          all.

          When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy activites that keep my
          physically and mentally active. Whether it's going to the gym,
          reading, or staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology
          and economics, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to stay engaged and
          continue learning.
