        <p>
          I’m a newly certified yoga instructor after practicing for over 25
          years. At 52, I’m embracing my purpose both on and off the mat while
          raising my teenage daughter and, Louis, our French Bulldog—each adding
          a touch of sparkle and vibrant energy to my journey. This path is
          about stepping boldly into who I am meant to be—living authentically,
          moving with intention, and staying perpetually sol-ful. I can’t wait
          to share this journey with you!
        </p>

          Empowering individuals to embrace presence, strength and vibrancy
          through the practice of yoga and mindful living. Rooted in balance,
          wellness, and self-discovery, we create a holistic space where
          movement meets intention, and every breath leads to transformation.
          With Louis, (my loyal french bulldog) —often joining us for class—we
          cultivate a sense of joy, connection, and positivity.
