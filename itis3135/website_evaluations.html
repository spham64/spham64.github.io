            <strong>Assessment: </strong>Arc'teryx implements the CRAP
            principles in a clean and professional way. On each page there are
            clear distinctions between items, consistent repetition,
            well-structured alignment, and proximity that enhances readability
            and navigation.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the product pages, the black text is hard to see against
                  the product image
                </li>
                <li>
                  The buy now box has edges at the top left and right while the
                  bottom edges are rounded

                  On the homepage, the text is placed at random everytime the

                <li>
                  Alignment of sections such as product description could be
                  better to improve visual flow

                  Not much grouping between products as the products are limited
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most of the user interaction is grouped at the center bottom

            <strong>Assessment: </strong> IONGAF demostrates basic prinicples of
            CRAP but lacks in a lot of areas. Although the website is different
            and amusing, some of the design choices are not user friendly. The
            black text is sometimes hard to read. There is random placement of
            text on the homepage making it difficult to follow. There is good
            alignment and proximity is good but limited as the page is fairly
            basic.
