        <p class="contract-statement">
          I, Sam N. Pham agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in
          my Spring 2025, ITIS 3135, Web-Based Application Design and
          Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p class="contract-statement">
          I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online
          tools will be available to the world, and will not put information
          there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
          private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for
          attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to
          turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
          the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many
          examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly.
        </p>
        <p class="contract-statement">
          I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not
          cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e.
          external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
